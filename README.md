Programming assignment second-semester third term (100 marks).

This was/is an assignment I was assigned to do individually during my first year second semester, to display our knowledge about HTML and CSS. This assignment practically focused on the depth of understanding the HTML tags and elements. The CSS was more focused on the styling but more importantly what the lecturer or the marking rubric wanted to highlight the most was the responsiveness of the web application. Unfortunately, I could not produce all the expected results in time due to poor planning therefore that was the missing part in my web application.

I ended up achieving 70% of the total mark granted. This was a disappointment to me because I already have/ had implemented responsiveness in my other previous projects and also the knowledge of it was solid enough. However, I also wanted to check my accuracy and coding skills by not using any third-party source code for this project. Hence, that being said this project was all hard coded and implemented by me.
